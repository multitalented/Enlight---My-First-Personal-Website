Hi! I'm an engineer experienced in technical writing and communication, and working with government regulations and codes from both contractor and government sides. I used to feel like I was supposed to stay boxed into “mechanical engineering” but increasingly I’ve realized to embrace that my interests go beyond things just mechanical.

I love to learn to the point of obsession. I have an active analytical mind combined with a natural creativity that allows me to always be able to entertain myself no matter what I’m doing. In any type of work, I like to figure out the big picture and then look for the aspects that intrigue me.

I enjoy helping others and passing on knowledge in hopes of improving an entire team. I don’t like when people get left behind!

I have dabbled in coding for years now, doing small scale projects whenever i was learning (web dev with HTML, CSS, JS; game dev with Unity, C#) or teaching myself some IT basics with powershell or linux command line and a VM. I also regularly use tools like MATLAB to look into data myself (e.g. right now developing tools to process covid datasets for myself). So I would like to improve these skills, as I know that being motivated with projects always gets me further than aimlessly learning like I've done with some of the Udemy and YouTube courses I've followed.

I really like thinking about what information data can tell us, and how it could be used to help understand and possibly solve complex real world problems in society, so some of my ideas revolve around that. Otherwise I get ideas for simple apps that are mostly directed by something that would be useful to me but I either can't find it on the app store or it's bloated with bells and whistles. I write music and play piano, so I also get ideas for tools to help me in that respect.
