<p>
Hi! I'm an engineer that prefers to be creative in all things I do. This will be my website to display some of those useless "talents" as I learn web development skills and put them to the test!

<!--
<br><br>
Starting here, I will provide a little bit of background on myself...!
<br><br> I'm experienced in technical writing and communication, and working with government regulations and codes from both contractor and government sides. I got my BS in mechanical engineering from the University of Florida, and I am currently pursuing a masters from Georgia Tech, but my interests go much beyond mechanical engineering.
<br><br>
I love to learn to the point of obsession. I have an active analytical mind combined with a natural creativity that allows me to always be able to entertain myself no matter what I’m doing. In any type of work, I like to figure out the big picture and then look for the aspects that intrigue me.
<br><br>
I enjoy helping others and passing on knowledge in hopes of improving an entire team. I don’t like when people get left behind!
<br><br>
I have dabbled in coding for years now doing small scale projects whenever I was learning (web dev with HTML, CSS, JS; game dev with Unity, C#) or teaching myself some IT basics with powershell or linux command line and a VM. I actually first started coding with HTML and early CSS when I was a young girl. I would use it to make websites and share animations of the cartoon characters I came up with. I also regularly use tools like MATLAB to look into data myself. I know that being motivated with projects always gets me further than aimless learning like I've done with some of the Udemy and YouTube courses I've followed.
<br><br>
I really like thinking about what information data can tell us, and how it could be used to help understand and possibly solve complex real world problems in society. In my free time, I am an avid reader between books and articles.
